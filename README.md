# Apple Store Ratings

## Project Context
We'll be working with two tables containing Apple Store App information and App Store descriptions. We'll be working with an aspiring app developer who needs data driven insights to decide what type of app to build. They are seeking questions to answer like;
1. What app categories are most popular?
2. What price should I set the app?
3. How can I maximize user ratings?

## Key Insights
1. Paid Apps have better ratings.
2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings.
3. Finance and Book genre apps have low ratings.
4. Apps with longer description have better ratings.
5. A new app should aim for an average of a rating above 3.5
6. Games and Entertainment are the most popular genres making it a high competition category.
